                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>Customer is the technology provider for a leading asset and portfolio management company. The customer provides the backend transaction processing and customer care for over 60% of the companies in the fund management business.<br><br> One of the core activities of the Customer was to process and send (as pdf emails) periodic transaction statements to end users and they had to adhere to a strict time SLA. This meant that their in-house infrastructure and a sizeable portion of their IT workforce were locked for the duration of the processing. Also, with their limited infra, they were not able to reduce the time window beyond a certain point.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <p>Batchly, the cloud driven enterprise data processing solution, was considered to run this process for one of the key customer accounts. Since the existing infrastructure was in-house, using Batchly required addressing two key areas; migrate the data which resides on an Oracle database and write the "unit of work" code (the business logic to process one record which is a requirement for Batchly). 
				<br><br>The customer created an Oracle RDS instance on Amazon and replicated the in-house Oracle DB (created a dump to Amazon RDS and set up a process which syncs additional data that is being generated on a daily basis). Their existing store procedure, which read from the DB and created a signed PDF copy was ported to Batchly container code. Amazon Simple Email Services was integrated to send the PDFs generated to the respective end users. 
				<br><br>With these addressed, Customer ran a workload on Batchly to process 100K records in approximately 50 minutes; 14 times faster than the 12 hours they used to take earlier. The processing itself saved over 70% costs compared to on-demand cloud costs because of Batchly's intelligent use of SPOT instances. 
				<br><br>Batchly completely automated the activities around instance provisioning, monitoring and failure handling. This resulted in huge savings with respect to IT overheads apart from the direct savings on cost & time.</p>
