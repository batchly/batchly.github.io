                <h2>About Indieflix</h2>
                <p>IndieFlix, Inc is an independent film distribution and online streaming service based in Seattle, WA.

                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>IndieFlix was acquiring a growing number of independent movies and were exploring several cloud based transcoders to support their transcoding requirements. Scilla says "In addition to desktop IndieFlix movies stream on mobile (iOS and Android) apps, and Roku. To support streaming to these devices we were looking for a cost effective solution to do the transcoding". Transcoding is a compute intensive activity and requires high end servers, especially for High Definition video transcoding.

                “We wanted to convert a large library (of 22,000 mezzanine videos) totalling 4.5TB into 10 video multivariant profiles (MP4 and WebM) and into 2 packaging mediums - HLS & MPEG-DASH.” says Brandon Woodward, Head of product at IndieFlix.</p>

                <h2>Why Batchly</h2>
                <p>Batchly is a general purpose data processing platform which allows customers to use AWS for fault-tolerant and interrupt tolerant
                workloads. "While comparing the costs with cloud transcoders, Batchly was 10X cheaper and 80% lower than AWS on-demand costs"
                says Brandon. Batchly's intelligent learning algorithm identifies the right instance type for the kind of job (by running a sampling activity) and bids and runs AWS EC2 Spot instances within customer's AWS account (inside a VPC as well).</p>

                <h2>Result</h2>
                <p>As an existing AWS user, IndieFlix was immediately able to use Batchly without any friction and bring down their AWS costs. Additionally, the company appreciated the flexibility and responsiveness of the Batchly team in setting up and configuring the product to suit their requirements. "The low cost and simplicity of the service made it a nobrainer to use Batchly" says Brandon.</p>
