<h4 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
<p><strong>What is Batchly?</strong></p>
<p>Batch.ly helps AWS users to achieve on-demand AWS availability at spot pricing. The Batch.ly SaaS based platform enables Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers to save up to 87% by optmially balancing, sizing, and automating compute resource management over AWS On-Demand, Reserved, and Spot EC2 instances. </p>
<p>Batchly’s unique algorithm and tighter integration with Auto Scaling Groups, Elastic Beanstalk, Custom AMI’s and EMR provides a highly reliable way to use Spot Instances in every layer of your application without compromising on your application’s uptime or availability. </p>
<p><strong>How can I achieve savings using Batchly?</strong></p>
<p>Batchly provides savings in 3 main areas of compute usage: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Instance distribution:</em> Using Spot instances, spot blocks and RIs instead of  On-Demand instances in the right distribution model to get direct savings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Scheduling:</em> QA &amp; Dev are major areas of AWS spending. Batchly provided the ability to automatically define and deploy instances and environment to specific schedules so that the instances are running only when needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Avoiding over provisioning:</em> Batchly continuously tracks and monitors instance utilization and automatically resizes instances to the right type so that instance over provisioning is avoided. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How much savings can I achieve using Batchly?</strong></p>
<p>Batchly can bring savings up to 87% on your compute (EC2) costs. Given the fact that EC2 costs account for the majority of AWS spend today, you can expect a savings of at least 30% on your overall AWS spend once you start using Batchly across all your applications. </p>
<p><strong>How can I trust spot instances when they’re prone to termination or if my application is not suited to run spot instances?</strong></p>
<p>Batchly uses historical information and prediction modeling to use a bidding strategy and instance selection model so that it tends to retain an instance it launches. This way, Batchly has a higher level retention capability for the spot instance it launches. For e.g., we have data for running a spot instance continuously for more than 30 days without losing it. </p>
<p>Batchly continuously monitors the spot instances it launches and if the likelihood of an instance getting terminated increases, it preempts a termination and swaps the instance to an on-demand instance without any intervention. </p>
<p>Batchly is not only about spot instances. Batchly uses a combination of On-demand, RI and Spot Instances to ensure a distribution model that gives deep cost savings without compromising on your application uptime. </p>
<p><strong>How can I reliably run my web application on spot instances as it can be terminated at any moment?</strong></p>
<p>Batchly provides a 3 level defense mechanism to ensure that you get deep cost savings without compromising on your application availability / uptime. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>First</em>: Batchly uses historical data and prediction modeling to identify the right bidding strategy and the right instance type in a spot market so that the instances that are launched are not terminated anytime soon. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Second</em>: Batchly’s continuous learning algorithm tracks the spot instances that were launched and preempts a termination by proactively swapping an instance out if the chances of failure are high. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Third</em>: Batchly lets users define a “minimum on-demand thresold” that will ensure that a part of the instances are always using on-demand instances. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These multiple lines of defense model of Batchly ensures even a web application can be run on Spot Instances while realizing large cost savings.</p>
<p><strong>What applications can I use Batchly for?</strong></p>
<p>Whether you are running your web apps on AWS (using Auto Scaling Group, ELB, Elastic BeanStalk or Custom AMI) or running EMR jobs or other solutions like JMeter load testing and video transcoding (using FFMPEG), you can benefit from Batchly and reduce your AWS costs significantly. </p>
<p><strong>I’m a Cloudability customer. Is Batchly a similar solution?</strong></p>
<p>No. Batchly is a solution that will execute cost savings by intelligent use of spot instances. Batchly can work in conjunction with Cloudability where you can track and analyze the performance of Batchly from your Cloudability dashboard. </p>
<!--
**I’m a Cloudability customer. How do I track the performance of Batchly?**

Refer to our detailed blog post on this. 
-->

<p><strong>I have purchased Reserved Instances. How useful will Batchly be for me?</strong></p>
<p>Batchly has automatic support for RIs. If you have purchased RIs and have them available, Batchly would automatically start using them as the first choice. Batchly would start launching spot or on-demand instances only after a partial or full consumption of your RIs ensuring maximum value to your RI spend. </p>
<p><strong>Do I need to add tags for Batchly?</strong></p>
<p>Batchly creates default tags for all instances it launches and it also supports the ability to add custom tags. </p>
<p><strong>Should I re-engineer or write code to use Batchly?</strong></p>
<p>No. Batchly has a unique app store model where most of your common AWS applications are preconfigured to help you get started without any additional coding or IT overhead. </p>
<p><strong>How secure is Batchly?</strong></p>
<p>From using a CloudFormation template for creating a role to storing all user account information in encrypted format and using HMAC-SHA1 authentication, Batchly takes security seriously at every step of your usage. </p>
<p><strong>How do I get started with Batchly?</strong></p>
<p>You can sign up for an account here and get started immediately by adding a AWS IAM Role ARN.  </p>
<p><strong>Should I share my AWS keys with Batchly?</strong></p>
<p>No. Batchly doesn’t require your AWS keys and uses a transparent role AWS IAM Role ARN approach to manage your AWS environment. </p>
<p><strong>What do I need to install?</strong></p>
<p>Batchly is a SaaS solution that doesn’t require the installation of any components. Batchly creates an AWS Role Amazon Resource Name (ARN) that is completely transparent and works in your account to balance and tune workloads.<a href="http://www.batchly.net/support/user-guide/security-policy/">Click here</a> to see details.</p>
<p><strong>How do you handle glitches and availability? How can I be sure that you will move the workload over? What happens when my spot instances get terminated?</strong></p>
<p>Batchly uses an algorithm that tends to hold on to the instances it launches. In cases where the spot instances get terminated,  Batchly would automatically launch additional instances (in most cases pre-emptively launch instances before the termination) and keep your application running without any intervention from your end. </p>
<!--
**How do I use the SLA module on your app that would be used on my application if I have an app running in Beanstalk with a load balancer in front and auto scaling enabled for the app?**

Batchly has pre-built app for Beanstalk in our app store. All you have to do is configure the app with information about your current Beanstalk info and Batchly would automatically start managing the app in the most optimized manner using Spot instances and OnDemand instances so that your application availability or uptime is compromised.
-->

<p><strong>Is there no way to define a more specific SLA? e.g. I need my app to have 99.99% uptime?</strong></p>
<p>When you actually configure your app in Batchly, you can specify your distribution between On-demand and Spot instances. We use following three line defense strategy so that you can have guaranteed uptime:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The ability to retain the spot instances we launch for much longer than norm using our predictive algorithm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continuously monitoring the instances and swapping high risk instances automatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having a part of the auto scaling group servers as on-demand. This ensures that you don't have to worry about spot termination and uptime issues.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With this approach, you can achieve the same level of uptime that you'd be getting currently on AWS.</p>
<p><strong>What exactly is a high risk instance? Just an instance that does not pass its health checks?</strong></p>
<p>High risk instance is a spot instance that is predicted by Batchly to be terminated by AWS soon. When Batchly launch a spot instance it could be low risk but over a period of time, it can become high risk and at that time, Batchly proactively replace it.</p>
<p><strong>Are on-demand instances always being ran just in case all of my spot instances get terminated?</strong></p>
<p>It is a choice you have. For low risk applications (like Dev / QA), you can have a full spot strategy. For prod workloads, you can go with a hybrid approach. All instances launched by Batchly will be tagged. You can track and trace everything that Batchly does from AWS console.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need to input the minimum number of on-demand instances I want in order to guarantee my uptime?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Does Batchly automatically kill spot instances that fail their health checks while still maintaining the minimum number of on-demand instances I specified?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Batchly does that. Not just spot instances, but even On-demand or RI that it launch, Batchly terminates them if they fail the health checks and send you the notification when do that.</p>
<p><strong>How does auto scaling work with you guys? Same deal as AWS's auto scaling?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. It is similar. We use the same Auto Scaling configuration and start managing it via Batchly.</p>
<p><strong>Do I specify some thresholds about when I want the scaling to occur and when a threshold is hit, the group is scaled?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Does Batchly choose whether the instance that gets spun up is spot or on-demand? Or is it always spot?</strong></p>
<p>Batchly, first use RI if you have subscribed to one. If not, then move to Spot instances and if the spot is not available, then  finally go for On-demand.</p>
<p><strong>Can I specify that I need that spot instance to be in a specific region?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. While configuring the application, you have to choose the region where you'd want the instances to be launched.</p></div>
